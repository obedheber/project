                Obed Trust Heber is a 24-year-old Nigerian who’s passionate about technology. From Cloud Engineering to AI and Cybersecurity, I am fascinated by how these fields are shaping the future. However, pursuing these tech dreams in the School of Engineering hasn’t been easy. With limited access to data, a faulty laptop, and the lack of a stable device while studying Computer Science at university, I realized that while the lectures provided a good foundation, they didn’t give the practical skills needed to succeed in today’s fast-paced tech world. This realization pushed me to seek out additional education that would better prepare me for the industry.

                As an unemployed young adult, I know that gaining the right skills is key to landing a job and securing my future. I see the tech industry as a gateway to new opportunities, where hard work and knowledge can truly pay off. That’s why I chose to enroll in ALT School. I believe that the school’s practical, hands-on approach is exactly what I need to bridge the gap between what I learned at university and what the industry demands.
